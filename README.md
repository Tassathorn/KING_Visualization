# KING Kinship Visualization

This script processes kinship data from KING software and generates a heatmap to visualize potential relationships.

## üìå About This Script

This scipt was developed by **Tassathorn Poonsin** to assist in tasks at **National Biobank of Thailand (NBT)**. While it was created for work purposes, this project is released as an open-source tool under the **APACHE LICENSE, VERSION 2.0**, allowing others to use it freely.

## üöÄ Features

- Reads `.kin` and `.kin0` files from a specified directory
- Computes relationship categories based on kinship values
- Generates a heatmap for visualization
- Saves the output in a structured directory

## üîß Installation & Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn argparse
```

## üìä Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
python king_visualization.py -i path/to/dataset -size font_size
```

For example:

```bash
ppython king_visualization.py -i path/to/king -size 8
```

This will search for `king.kin` and `king.kin0` inside `path/to/` and generate a heatmap.

## üìÇ Output

- The script will save the heatmap to:
  ```
  result_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS/Heatmap_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.png
  ```
- The directory structure will look like:
  ```
  result_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Heatmap_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.png
  ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Ensure `.kin` and `.kin0` files exist in the provided directory.
- If no valid input files are found, the script will exit with an error.
